# More Than Certified - Terraform

This repo will be moving soon. Pleasee be patient as the course is still in preview and I need to get things polished and cleaned up. More details to come! 

### How to use this repo

git clone https://github.com/morethancertified/mtc-terraform.git

Each directory is named after the lesson to which it refers. Within each directory, you will find the files that
correspond to the final configuration for that lesson.

If you wish to start with the configuration used at the beginning of a lesson, use the directory from the previous lesson. 

Don't forget to run a `terraform init` for each new directory you use! 

For question, feel free to join the  `#terraform` channel in https://techstudyslack.com!
